# Ensemble Methods: Harnessing the Power of Multiple Models

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various ensemble methods in machine learning, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Stacking, and Voting. It accompanies the Medium post "Ensemble Methods: Harnessing the Power of Multiple Models".

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need Python 3.6 or later. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ensemble-methods.git
   cd ensemble-methods
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To generate all visualizations and see the performance metrics, run:

```
python ensemble_methods.py
```

This will create PNG files for visualizations and print performance metrics in the console.

## Visualizations

This script generates the following visualizations:

1. `random_forest_importances.png`: Feature importances from Random Forest
2. `gradient_boosting_importances.png`: Feature importances from Gradient Boosting

## Methods Covered

1. Bagging (Random Forest)
2. Boosting (Gradient Boosting)
3. Stacking
4. Voting

Each method is explained in detail in the accompanying Medium post, including:
- How it works
- Pros and cons
- Python implementation using scikit-learn
- Performance metrics
